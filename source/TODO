sim:

- Fix L2 cache
-- Add the shadow history for each warp
--- This should be requests coming out of the icnt_wrapper
-- For warps that does not benefit from the cache -> bypass the cache
--- Then prioritize warps with low number of L2 misses in the memory
- See if we can learn from the first thread in the warp
-- If the cache access will become the miss
-- If we can prefetch future warps (given that warp schedulers is somewhat deterministic)
